## Languages used for each day 

| Day    | Language | Used Before | Comment |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1  | Bash    | Yes | I do not like Bash for non-trivial tasks | 
| 2  | Zig    | No | Zig was nice. Good support in vscode. Somewhat like Rust, but more bare-bones. | 
| 3  | C    | Yes | C is obviously fine for these kinds of problems. |
| 4  | Prolog (SWI) | Yes | Reading the input was painful, but doing the algorithm was fun. | 
| 5  | Nim    | No | Did not like Nim. I did not get the language support to work well (or it lacks features). List comprehensions are weird, lacking pattern-matching-features. |
